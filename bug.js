While developing a React Native app using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the application would crash intermittently on iOS devices. The crash reports provided little to no information about the root cause. I tried the basic debugging steps like cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking for conflicting packages. However, none of these resolved the problem. The crash occurred without any specific user interaction or code changes. It seemed entirely random.
